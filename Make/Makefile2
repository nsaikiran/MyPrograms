# In receipe section, we write commands to update the target.			\
Every command written in a line will be executed in an instance of shell	\
So, if the commands are dependent on each other they have to be mentioned	\
in single line.



.PHONY : home parent-dir pwd
#										\
The first target (except starting with . like .PHONY ) will be the main target	\
Hence when I run with dummy as a target it assumes home as main target even if	\
it is PHONY target. And there is no file  ( home ) exists hence it will execute	\
the receipe given (blindly). So, I am diverting make with dummy as a target 	\
which doesn't dependent on anything and have no receipe.

dummmy :
	
home :
	cd ; pwd
	echo "home directory "

parent-dir:
	cd .. ; pwd
	echo "Parent directory of present working directory"

pwd:
	pwd
	echo "Present working directory"
